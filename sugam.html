                The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, 
                Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time 
                and were integral to the development of 1960s 
                counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.
                Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound 
                incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from
                folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. 
                As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles 
                revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised
                as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.
                <br>Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group,
                the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960,
                initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958,
                went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. 
                Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, 
                greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. 
                As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname 
                "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a "fifth Beatle".

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>1956–1963: Formation</h3>
            <p>Main article: <strong><em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quarrymen" target="blank">The Quarrymen</a></em></strong></p>
            <p>In November 1956, sixteen-year-old John Lennon formed a skiffle group with several 
                friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before
                changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that another local 
                group were already using 
                the name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney met Lennon on 6 July 1957, and joined as a rhythm guitarist 
                shortly after. 
                In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison, then aged fifteen, to watch the band.
                Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison
                was too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), Harrison
                performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool
                bus, and they enlisted him as lead guitarist.
            </p>
            <p>By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College
                of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever
                they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings 
                and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960. He suggested changing the 
                band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when 
                they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and 
                fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the 
                middle of August simply the Beatles.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Early residencies and UK popularity</strong></p>
            <p>Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg. They auditioned and 
                hired drummer Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed Liverpool for Hamburg four days
                later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 5-month residency. Beatles historian
                Mark Lewisohn writes: "They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area 
                comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily 
                clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities."
